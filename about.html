        <p>
            Hi, my online pseudonym is Shung3, but you can call me Shung. I created Tycables to hopefully provide a better experience to those who
            are interested in buying or making their own high quality cables.
        </p>
        <p>
            On my homepage, you should find links to configurators to commission a cable from me, or to buy the loose parts to put together yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
            On our top navigation bar, you may also look through my blog, where I go over the basic tools required to build a cable. In the future, I plan on
            creating videos or visual step-by-step walkthroughs to help quell user confusion and aid those who require more visual instructions to learn
        </p>
        <p>
            With my website, I hope to provide more people the knowledge on how to start making cables and make it more accessible to everyone. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If anybody is interested, the site name has no real deep meaning, I just thought it sounded nice.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Notice:</strong> <em>configurators or anything related to actually shopping will not work 
                as I have no idea how to implement such features. </em>
        </p>
