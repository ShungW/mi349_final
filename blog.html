            <p>A quick walkthrough on the tools I use and recommend for making cables</p>
            <time datetime="2021-12-06"><em>December 6<sup>th</sup>, 2021</em></time>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>I understand going and tackling any project may seem scary initially, but I hope that this post will be able to leave you with
                a baseline understanding of the tools that are required to assemble a cable. My hopes in showing this would be to allow those interested
                in creating their own cables to acquire the correct tools and not to buy anything that would be unnecessary.
                Essentially, I am hoping that this post will allow you, the reader, to make a more informed purchase decision.
            </p>
            <p>For ease of access, the tools that I personally use will be linked, however, please don't feel compelled to buy them, as there
                are many tools that may rival or are better than what I use. Please only use this post as a baseline and not a bible!
            </p>
            <h3>Essential Tools</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Hakko-FX888D-23BY-Digital-Soldering-Station/dp/B00ANZRT4M/">Soldering Iron</a></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Finding a USB kit that doesn't require soldering is rather rare, and the ones that I found that don't require soldering often
                        have issues with an unstable connection, or just a more unsightly appearance. The products sold on this site will be solder
                        only for those reasons stated prior, and therefore a soldering iron is absolutely required to build the kits on this site.
                        I personally use a HAKKO FX888D, but there are many other options available. Besides HAKKO: Weller, YIHUA, and SainSmart are
                        other brands which sell reputable soldering irons.

                    <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001W2XZOS/">Solder</a></li>
                <li>
                    <p>I would advise you to get leaded solder. I personally use Kester 66/44 (66% tin, 44% lead) solder. Lead-free solder is not 
                        something I would recommend for a user new to soldering, as lead-free solder requires higher temperatures to melt properly.
                        This higher melting point greatly increases the chance having "cold joints" or "lifted pads", both of which are not 
                        good for the cable. A cold joint could result in issues in connectivity or a voltage spike, whilst lifted pads can result
                        in the cable not working at all! You may use lead-free solder if you wish, but please keep in mind that it's slightly harder to work with.

                    <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FZPHMUG/">Wire strippers/Knife</a></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Wire strippers can be considered a quality of life item, but a knife or sharp cutting object is definitely required to 
                        strip the rubber coating of the wire to get to the copper or wiring underneath. I use a HAKKO CHP-30-1 Wire Stripper.
                    </p>

                    <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Zippo-Street-Chrome-Pocket-Lighter/dp/B000MT8Y98/">Lighter</a></li>
                <li>
                    <p>If you're planning on using paracord or techflex to add color or protect your cable, a lighter or heat gun is necessary for the job.
                        For actually applying the heatshrink, it's necessary as well. I personally use a Zippo, but any lighter or heat gun will do.</p>

            <h3>Quality of Life Tools</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/AdTech-05660-High-Combo-GREEN/dp/B00NF92CP4/">Hot Glue Gun</a></li>
                <li>    
                    <p>Hot glue acts as an insulator. It will prevent the cables from accidently shorting if the wires are soldered partially 
                        (though this should be avoided) or placed oddly. Hot glue will also prevent the housing of the USB cable from coming apart 
                        easily. I use a non-branded gun I got from a Dollar Tree. Just for your ease, I will include a Amazon link to a similarly priced
                    glue gun.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/AstroAI-Multimeter-Resistance-Transistors-Temperature/dp/B071JL6LLL/">Multimeter</a></li>
                <li>   
                    <p>A multimeter is necessary for diagnosing if you soldered the cable properly. You can check if the pins are soldered by checking
                        for continuity, and after checking, you can determine if the soldering job was successful or not, or if you accidently bridged
                        something. I use a cheap multimeter that I bought from Harbor Freight. For your ease, I will include an Amazon link to a similarly priced
                        multimeter. I have chosen to put this in quality of life, but a multimeter is something I very highly recommend having. Early on
                        when I was making cables, I had damaged a keyboard PCB irreparably. Please do not repeat my mistake.

                <li>
                    <p>Helping hands, as their name entails, acts as an extra set of hands. They're immensely helpful. I use
                        them as I solder the joints of the cables. I personally use a helping hands from Proskit, but many variations are out there.
                        The alligator clips of my particular model hold onto the cable and connector and with that I can easily guide the wire onto the 
                        solder pads and solder a connection much  easier than doing it freehand, or on a table.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <p>As you may have guessed, or know, soldering releases fumes. These fumes aren't something that you should inhale. 
                        I use an Aoyue 486 Smoke Absorber to lower the amount of the fumes that I inhale, and you should purchase something similar,
                    but you can also DIY one out of an old computer fan. There are many guides online if you decide to look. If you can't afford one, 
                or if you aren't able to make one, I suggest soldering outside or in an area with adequate ventilation. Also, please wash your hands
            when you are finished soldering. The lead isn't something you breathe in, but rather it ends up on your hands or your work surface. 
        Please stay safe.</p>
